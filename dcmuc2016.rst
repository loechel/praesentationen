Free & Open Source Software
===========================

Free & Open Source Software did have a strong tradition in the academia.

Licenses
--------

* GPL
* MIT
* BSD

Bases for Academic & Science
============================

Science, Research and therefor Academia are based on asking new questions on existing knowledge or observations

Keys of Science
---------------

* Transparent

  * Testing
  * Analysis
  * Replication

* Sharing of Knowledge and Review

  * recording and sharing
  * external review - peer review
  * replication

FOSS Principia - four essential freedoms
========================================

.. class:: fs26px

    0. The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.
    1. The freedom to **study** how the program works, and adapt it to your needs.
    2. The freedom to **redistribute copies** so you can help your neighbor.
    3. The freedom to **improve** the program, and **release** your improvements **to the public**, so that the whole community benefits.

.. container:: centered

    *Access to the source code is a precondition for this*

Science is based on existing Knowledge
======================================

* analyse
* discuss and have a discourse
* adapt and enhance
* redistribute & share

Academia: Science, Teaching and Research is about sharing and enhancing knowledge
=================================================================================

.. epigraph::

    Free software is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of “*free*” as in “*free speech*”, not as in “*free beer*”.

    Science and knowledge is not about the money |br|
    Freedom of Science is a high value

    Kunst und Wissenschaft, Forschung und Lehre sind frei.

    -- Art. 5 - Grundgesetz der Bundesrepublik Deutschland

.. note::


    Science and knowledge is not about the money |br|
    Freedom of Science is a high value and quite expensive

    **Orientation**

.. note::

    Do not orientate only upwards also downwards or to direct neighbours

    There is only one guaranteed way |rarr| Down till death or forgetness

    Look at the Products, they survive because the focus on a specific need and niche market
    There are normaly better in this special case

    A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked.
    The inverse proposition also appears to be true:
    A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work.
    You have to start over, beginning with a working simple system.

.. epigraph::

    Those who do not study Zope, are condemned to reinvent it.

    -- Foreword for "Web Component Development with Zope 3" 2nd Edition 2007 by PJ Eby; |br| Python Core Developer - Creator of Setuptools (Python Packaging), WSGI-Specification

.. note::

    So it has been for a decade, and the trend doesn’t show any signs of stopping.
    Whatever the latest buzzword—be it RESTful web programming, standardized
    interfaces, pluggable components, or practical restricted-execution
    environments, Zope has quietly led the way, delivering the goods years ahead
    of anyone else. Not just as technology concepts, but shipped and working in
    paying clients’ offices.

    And yet, strangely, Zope’s role in the ongoing development of Python
    is little-known and little-appreciated among Python developers. It is frequently
    the case that some new and much-touted development in the Python
    community—especially in the web application and object security arenas—is
    something that Zope has already been doing for many years.

    I’m somewhat baffled by this peculiar blind spot in the Python community.
    Even when I tell people that Zope’s already done something that they’re
    working on, the response is usually a blank look, or no response at all. It’s
    almost as if the innovations of Zope don’t really exist until somebody else
    reinvents them. In fact, the pattern has led me coin this little saying:

    *The Zen of Python*

    .. code:: python

        >>> import this
        The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

    Beautiful is better than ugly.
    **Explicit is better than implicit.**
    **Simple is better than complex.**
    **Complex is better than complicated.**
    Flat is better than nested.
    Sparse is better than dense.
    **Readability counts.**
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    ...

.. note::

    PEP20 was also written with Zope in mind - Python should learn from the Mistakes of Zope

Don't be complicated
====================

* Introduce a Layer-Concept |br|
  Abstraction Layers define:

  * bounderies for functionality
  * an API

* Reuse standard Frameworks

* be reproducible (especially on Setups)

*Drupal 8 feels a lot like Plone 2.5 or Plone 3 Series*

.. note::

    Drupal 8:

    * Symfony
    * Doctrine
    * Drush
    * Twig (Armin Ronacher - Python Flask)
    * Composer / Conductor

    Plone started with 2.5:

    * zc.buildout
    * ZCA
    * ZTK
    * ZODB

    Plone is now at Plone 5.1 coming up

    Every company gets about three innovation tokens.

.. note::

    **Embrace Boredom.** -- Dan McKinley, "Choose Boring Technology"

    Let's say every company gets about three innovation tokens.
    You can spend these however you want, but the supply is fixed for a long while.
    You might get a few more after you achieve a certain level of stability and maturity,
    but the general tendency is to overestimate the contents of your wallet.
    Clearly this model is approximate, but I think it helps.

    If you choose to write your website in NodeJS,
    you just spent one of your innovation tokens.
    If you choose to use MongoDB, you just spent one of your innovation tokens.
    If you choose to use service discovery tech that's existed for a year or less,
    you just spent one of your innovation tokens.
    If you choose to write your own database, oh god, you're in trouble.
