    Welcome to the LMU

    **Questions to Auditorium:**

    * Who among you know the CMS-Garden

    * Who among you know Zope and Plone?

Free & Open Source Software
===========================

Free & Open Source Software did have a strong tradition in the academia.

Licenses
--------

* GPL
* MIT
* BSD

.. note::

    * GPL (Richard Stallman - MIT - Massachusetts Institute of Technology )
    * MIT License (Massachusetts Institute of Technology - Cambridge/Boston)

Bases for Academic & Science
============================

Science, Research and therefor Academia are based on asking new questions on existing knowledge or observations

Keys of Science
---------------

* Transparent

  * Testing
  * Analysis
  * Replication

* Sharing of Knowledge and Review

  * recording and sharing
  * external review - peer review
  * replication

FOSS Principia - four essential freedoms
========================================

.. class:: fs26px

    0. The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.
    1. The freedom to **study** how the program works, and adapt it to your needs.
    2. The freedom to **redistribute copies** so you can help your neighbor.
    3. The freedom to **improve** the program, and **release** your improvements **to the public**, so that the whole community benefits.

.. container:: centered

    *Access to the source code is a precondition for this*

Science is based on existing Knowledge
======================================

* analyse
* discuss and have a discourse
* adapt and enhance
* redistribute & share

Academia: Science, Teaching and Research is about sharing and enhancing knowledge
=================================================================================

.. epigraph::

    Free software is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of “*free*” as in “*free speech*”, not as in “*free beer*”.

    Science and knowledge is not about the money |br|
    Freedom of Science is a high value

Traversal
=========

.. container:: centered

    /site/folder/page

.. code:: python

    {'site': {'folder': {'page': page_object}}}

.. note::

    Look at this simple URL

    * This part of the URL is called the “path”. You can see that it looks a lot like a filesystem path.
    * Static web servers like Apache or Nginx serve static content by walking the filesystem, following these paths and returning the item at the end of the path as an HTTP response.
    * CGI, the dominant dynamic web technology of the early days, works the same way, except that the path ends in an executable script that generates HTTP headers and a response body.

    ... could we not, then, transform this filesystem hierarchy into a series of nested objects?

    Treating path segments like keys would allow us to walk the chain of contained objects just
    like walking a filesystem.

    Then, when the right object is found, what should we do with it?

Zope2 - The Python Web Application Server
=========================================

.. image:: images/philip/perl.png
    :width: 700px
    :class: centered
    :alt: perl

.. note::

    Side Story:

    Python was not really that big at that time
    so Digital Creations paid $100.000 to build a Perl-runtime into Zope.
    ... and 2 people actually used it.
    In Zope you were even able to run Perl *and* PHP scripts.

    And Zope became very popular - not because of Perl and PHP - but because
     it allowed new developers to build powerful applications with only a browser.

    It lowered the bar to get started in web development.

    **Empowering of Users**

.. note::

    Plone wraps the cool technical features of Zope and provides a nice user interface.

    After Plone's first public release in October 2001, it quickly gained users and mindshare.

    **Sprints**

    more than one sprint per month on average

    **Symposia**

    specific subgroups or areas

    * Plone Symposium East / Midwest (US university focus)
    * Plone Symposium South America (Brazil)
    * Plone Symposium Tokyo
    * Plone Open Gardens

.. note::

    Development usually happens in sprints. The term "sprint" was coined by the Zope community.

    In 2003 there was a sprint in a real castle in Austria,
    hosted by a real life prince. An Austrian TV crew was there reporting about the sprint.

    Back then it was still a weird thing that people would spend their free time
    and their own money to travel and work on something that they would then give away for
    free to people they didn't know.

    Nowadays when you read a bug report on GitHub it sometimes feels like everybody
    expects you to work for free to do their job.

    Last month we held a 15th anniversary sprint in the very same castle, with the very same prince.

    Every company gets about three innovation tokens.

.. note::

    **Embrace Boredom.** -- Dan McKinley, "Choose Boring Technology"

    Let's say every company gets about three innovation tokens.
    You can spend these however you want, but the supply is fixed for a long while.
    You might get a few more after you achieve a certain level of stability and maturity,
    but the general tendency is to overestimate the contents of your wallet.
    Clearly this model is approximate, but I think it helps.

    If you choose to write your website in NodeJS,
    you just spent one of your innovation tokens.
    If you choose to use MongoDB, you just spent one of your innovation tokens.
    If you choose to use service discovery tech that's existed for a year or less,
    you just spent one of your innovation tokens.
    If you choose to write your own database, oh god, you're in trouble.

        Complex is better than complicated.
        Flat is better than nested.
